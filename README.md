# Checkers AI

This is a Javascript implementation of the Minimax algorithm, a recursive algorithm for choosing the next move in an n-player game. This one happened to play checkers, but the AI could be used for many other games, such as chess, with minor adjustments. I also employed the Alpha/Beta Pruning optimization technique, so the algorithm could more efficiently evaluate future gamestates.

The AI was plugged into private game framework, and so far, has been able to beat any human opponent.
